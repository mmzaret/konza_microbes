# konza_microbes

These data sets and scripts were used to test predictions about the role of bison and fire in controlling soil microbial diversity and community assembly mechanisms at Konza Prairie Biological Station, Manhattan, Kansas, USA.

The repository contains R phyloseq objects (both raw and rarefied sequence table versions), csv files, and R scripts. The metadata in the R objects includes the sample IDs, experimental design, soil chemistry results, and geographic coordinates. The accompanying R script can be used in conjunction with those R objects to replicate analyses we did for this project.
